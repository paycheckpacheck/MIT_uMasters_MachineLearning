This github repo contains a few scripts I wrote during my enrollemnt in the MIT uMastersProgram for Data Science and Machine Learning. I sadly lost all my other scripts but this still contains some interesting stuff like perceptrons kernals, and a bit of intro to SVM.

This GitHub repository provides a collection of Python scripts designed for stock analysis using the Kalman Filter, various utility functions for data manipulation and visualization, machine learning algorithms for classification, and numerical operations with NumPy. Below is a summary of each script included in the repository:

**kalman_stock.py:** Implements the Kalman Filter for stock data analysis, including classes for filtering and data retrieval, and a visualization component using matplotlib.

**myUtiils.py:** Contains utility functions for data processing, such as sentiment analysis, dataset management, hyperparameter tuning, and plotting decision boundaries.

**ComputeHingeLoss.py:** Provides functions to calculate hinge loss and squared error loss, essential for evaluating machine learning models.

**numpy_UNIT0.py:** Demonstrates various NumPy array operations, basic arithmetic, norm calculations, and a simple neural network example.

**PlottingModule.py:** Features a DataPlotter class for plotting functions, interpolating data, and array visualization.

**PerceptionAlgorithm.py**: Contains the implementation of the perceptron algorithm for binary classification, including utility functions for feature vector creation and sign determination.

**Project1MIT_writeable.py:** Offers a comprehensive suite of functions and implementations for machine learning tasks, including the perceptron algorithm, Pegasos algorithm, feature extraction, and accuracy evaluation.

Additional scripts (PSET2_P1b.py, writeable_test_project1.py) are included for supplementary examples and testing of the algorithms and functions provided.

This toolkit is designed to be modular, allowing users to leverage individual scripts or components as needed for their specific data analysis and machine learning tasks. Whether you're analyzing stock data, building classification models, or simply exploring numerical operations with Python, this repository offers a range of tools to assist in your endeavors.
